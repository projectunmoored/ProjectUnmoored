## What is Project Unmoored?

Child abuse can negatively affect the survivor's personality development and ability to regulate their emotions, which can lead to self-destructive and impulsive behaviors, such as repeated self-harm or recurrent suicide attempts as examples. Those who have been repeatedly abused over time may experience dissociation and enter trance states, often triggered by reminders of the abuse, in which they relive such traumatic experiences. This type of abuse is strongly associated with depression, aggression, hostility, anger, fear, anxiety disorders, and adult personality disorders. At least 3 meta-analyzes on the effects of child sexual abuse find clear and convincing evidence of a link between such abuse and a range of adult psychological symptoms.
Whether the trauma occurred in childhood or adolescence, it inevitably changes the perspective of yourself and surroundings.
Taking into account the negative impact, both mentally and psychologically, as previously stated, the Project Unmoored aims to offer easy access to psychological care lines where mental health is prioritized; meaning your feelings and struggles will not remain overseen at any time. Simultaneously, as an action plan, there will be a group of guests specialized in health to host conferences through the new Twitter Spaces modality.
This pain wonâ€™t be for evermore.
